# Evire Gaming Framework - Game Mechanics

## Overview

This document outlines the core game mechanics implemented in the Evire Gaming Framework. Our framework leverages blockchain technology to create decentralized, transparent, and immutable gaming experiences. The following mechanics are designed to be modular, allowing developers to mix and match features to create unique gaming experiences.

## Player Management

### Player Registration and Authentication

- Players register using their Evire wallet address
- KYC (Know Your Customer) checks are performed through the `KYC.sol` contract
- Authentication is managed via digital signatures

### Player Profile

- Each player has a unique on-chain profile stored in `PlayerState.sol`
- Profiles include:
  - Unique player ID (Evire address)
  - Username (changeable, uniqueness enforced)
  - Experience points (XP)
  - Achievements
  - Owned assets

## Asset System

### Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

- Implemented using the ERC-721 standard in `NFTAsset.sol`
- Represent unique in-game items, characters, or land parcels
- Metadata stored on IPFS, with hash references on-chain

### Fungible Tokens

- Implemented using the ERC-20 standard in `FungibleToken.sol`
- Represent in-game currencies, resources, or experience points
- Minting and burning controlled by `GameManager.sol`

### Asset Factory

- `AssetFactory.sol` allows for dynamic creation of both NFTs and fungible tokens
- Utilizes proxy patterns for gas-efficient deployment of new asset types

## Game State and Progression

### Game State Management

- Core game state stored in `GameState.sol`
- Includes global parameters, current game phase, and aggregate statistics

### Player Progression

- Individual player progress tracked in `PlayerState.sol`
- `ProgressionSystem.sol` manages leveling, skill improvements, and unlocks
- Experience points (XP) are fungible tokens, allowing for flexible progression mechanics

## Economy and Marketplace

### In-Game Economy

- `Token.sol` implements the main in-game currency
- Multiple token types can coexist (e.g., gold, gems, energy)
- `RewardSystem.sol` manages distribution of rewards for completing tasks or winning battles

### Marketplace

- `Marketplace.sol` facilitates peer-to-peer trading of assets
- Supports both auction and fixed-price sales
- Implements escrow mechanism for secure trades

### Auction System

- `Auction.sol` allows for time-bound competitive bidding on rare items
- Supports English auctions (ascending price) and Dutch auctions (descending price)

## Randomness and Fairness

### Random Number Generation

- `RandomNumberGenerator.sol` uses a combination of on-chain and off-chain sources for unpredictable randomness
- Implements commit-reveal scheme to prevent manipulation
- `RandomOracle.sol` can be used for high-stakes random events, pulling from Chainlink VRF

### Fairness Mechanisms

- All critical random events are verifiable on-chain
- `GameLibrary.sol` includes functions for fair distribution algorithms (e.g., weighted randomness for loot drops)

## Leaderboards and Achievements

### Leaderboard System

- `LeaderboardSystem.sol` maintains global and game-specific leaderboards
- Updates are gas-optimized using off-chain computation and periodic on-chain updates
- Players can claim rewards based on their leaderboard position

### Achievement System

- Achievements are NFTs minted by `GameManager.sol` upon completing specific tasks
- `PlayerState.sol` tracks individual achievements
- Some achievements may grant special privileges or bonuses in-game

## State Channels for Real-Time Gaming

### Implementation

- `StateChannel.sol` manages opening, updating, and closing of state channels
- Allows for off-chain transactions and game moves with on-chain settlement
- Particularly useful for turn-based games or rapid microtransactions

### Dispute Resolution

- Built-in challenge mechanism for disputing final state
- Time-locked withdrawals to allow for challenge periods
- Fraud proofs can be submitted to resolve conflicts
